# Project Background
Gett, previously known as GetTaxi, is an Israeli-developed technology platform solely focused on corporate Ground Transportation Management (GTM). They have an application where clients can order taxis, and drivers can accept their rides (offers). At the moment, when the client clicks the Order button in the application, the matching system searches for the most relevant drivers and offers them the order. In this task, we would like to investigate some matching metrics for orders that did not completed successfully, i.e., the customer didn't end up getting a car.

# Executive Summary
1. The highest number of cancellations is the result of no driver being assigned and cancelled by the client
2. The number of cancelled orders peaks around 8 am and is highest during the night-time hours
3. The average time to cancel is lower when no driver is assigned.
4. The number of failed orders increases as the average waiting time of the client increases
